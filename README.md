Toxy
====

Metro-style Tox client for Windows. ([Tox](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core "ProjectTox GitHub repo") is a free (as in freedom) Skype replacement.)

At this point, this project isn't feature-complete and is not ready for an official release.
Some features may be missing or partially broken. Updates will arrive in time.

Feel free to contribute.

### Things you'll need

* Libraries of the [MetroFramework](https://github.com/viperneo/winforms-modernui "MetroFramework GitHub repo")

* The [SharpTox library](https://github.com/Impyy/SharpTox "SharpTox GitHub repo") and its dependencies.
